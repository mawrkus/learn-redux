# Redux

https://redux.js.org/

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Installation

From scratch:

```bash
yarn add redux
```

Started kit (https://redux-starter-kit.js.org):

```bash
yarn add redux-starter-kit
```

## Motivation

- Managing an app state that changes a lot is hard (especially in frontend).
- How to keep control over the "when?", "why?", and "how?" of the app state?
- How to make state mutations predictable?

## Concepts

- The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside **a single store**.
- The only way to change the state tree is **to emit an action**, an object describing what happened.
- To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write **pure reducers**.

Benefits:

- more predictable apps (single source of truth, unidirectional data flow)
- traceability of every state mutations -> undo/redo is trivial (aka "time travel debugging")
- state can be easily persisted and restored (from server or any storage)
- easier to debug/inspect a single state tree
- apps scale really nicely

### Store

It's an object that holds the whole state of your app.

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux');

// TODO: define a reducer

const store = createStore(reducer);
```

### Actions

- Disptaching actions is **the only way** to mutate the internal state.
- Each action is an **object with a type** that describes what hapened.

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux');

// TODO: define a reducer

// API -> { subscribe, dispatch, getState }
const store = createStore(reducer);

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

store.dispatch({ type: 'LIKE' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'LIKE' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'DISLIKE' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'LIKE' });
```

### Reducers

- A reducer is a **pure function** that receives the actual state and the action as arguments.
- It decides how every action transforms the actual state into the next state.
- It should **never mutate the state** received, but should always return a brand new object if the state changes.

A pure function is a function that returns the exact same output for given inputs, it is also be free of side-effects.

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux');

/*
  * @param {*} state Can be object, array or primitive
  * @param {Object} action
  * @param {String} action.type
*/
function reducer(state = { likes: 0, dislikes: 0 }, action) {
  // Remember `Array.prototype.reduce((acc, value) => ...)` ? ;)
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LIKE':
      return {
        ...state,
        likes: state.likes + 1,
      };

    case 'DISLIKE':
      return {
        ...state,
        dislikes: state.dislikes + 1,
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const store = createStore(reducer);

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

store.dispatch({ type: 'LIKE' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'LIKE' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'DISLIKE' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'LIKE' });
```

## Best practices

### Scaling

as the app grows, split the root reducer into smaller reducers that operates independently on the different parts of the state tree and combine them.

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux');

const reactionsReducer = (state = { likes: 0, dislikes: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LIKE':
      return {
        ...state,
        likes: state.likes + 1,
      };

    case 'DISLIKE':
      return {
        ...state,
        dislikes: state.dislikes + 1,
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const commentsReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_COMMENT':
      return [
        ...state,
        action.text,
      ];

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const reducer = (state = { reactions: { likes: 0, dislikes: 0 }, comments: [] }, action) => {
  return {
    reactions: reactionsReducer(state.reactions, action),
    comments: commentsReducer(state.comments, action),
  };
};

const store = createStore(reducer);

// ...
```

Using built-in `combineReducers()`:

```js
const {
  createStore,
  combineReducers,
} = require('redux');

const reactions = (state = { likes: 0, dislikes: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LIKE':
      return {
        ...state,
        likes: state.likes + 1,
      };

    case 'DISLIKE':
      return {
        ...state,
        dislikes: state.dislikes + 1,
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const comments = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_COMMENT':
      return [
        ...state,
        action.text,
      ];

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const reducer = combineReducers({ reactions, comments });

const store = createStore(reducer);

// ...
```

### Middlewares

A middleware is a higher-order function that composes a dispatch function to return a new dispatch function. It often turns async actions into actions.

Middleware is composable using function composition. It is useful for logging actions, performing side effects like routing, or turning an asynchronous API call into a series of synchronous actions.

See applyMiddleware(...middlewares) for a detailed look at middleware.

### Actions creators

An action creator is, quite simply, a function that creates an action. Do not confuse the two termsâ€”again, an action is a payload of information, and an action creator is a factory that creates an action.

Calling an action creator only produces an action, but does not dispatch it. You need to call the store's dispatch function to actually cause the mutation. Sometimes we say bound action creators to mean functions that call an action creator and immediately dispatch its result to a specific store instance.

If an action creator needs to read the current state, perform an API call, or cause a side effect, like a routing transition, it should return an async action instead of an action.

### Async actions

The base `dispatch()` function always synchronously sends an action to the store's reducer, along with the previous state returned by the store, to calculate a new state.
It expects actions to be plain objects ready to be consumed by the reducer.

A **middleware** wraps the base `dispatch()` function and allows it to handle async actions as well.
It may transform, delay, ignore, or otherwise interpret actions or async actions before passing them to the next middleware.

An async action is a value that is sent to a dispatching function, but is not yet ready for consumption by the reducer. It will be transformed by middleware into an action (or a series of actions) before being sent to the base dispatch() function. Async actions may have different types, depending on the middleware you use. They are often asynchronous primitives, like a Promise or a thunk, which are not passed to the reducer immediately, but trigger action dispatches once an operation has completed.
